# Weco JS Store

Welcome to the Weco JS store! This guide is designed to introduce you to the core concepts of Weco JS store, a powerful library for managing state in your Weco JS applications. At the heart of Weco JS is the store, which enables you to maintain and manipulate your application's state in a clean and efficient way.

## Overview of Core Concepts
* **Stores**: A store is where your application’s state is stored. It acts as the central hub for managing and updating your data.
* **Action Reducers**: Action reducers define how the state is updated in response to actions that are dispatched.
* **Selectors**: Selectors are functions that allow you to retrieve specific pieces of data from the store’s state in a structured way.
* **Subscriptions**: Subscriptions let your components listen for changes to state or selectors so they can react to updates in real-time.

This documentation will help you understand how to:
* Define an action reducer to update your store’s state.
* Create selectors to extract specific data from the store.
* Subscribe to state and selector changes to keep your components in sync with the application’s state.
