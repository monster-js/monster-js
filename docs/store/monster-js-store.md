# Monster JS Store

Welcome to the Monster JS store! This guide is designed to introduce you to the core concepts of Monster JS store, a powerful library for managing state in your Monster JS applications. At the heart of Monster JS is the store, which enables you to maintain and manipulate your application's state in a clean and efficient way.

## Overview of Core Concepts
* **[Store](store/monster-js-store.md)**: A store is where your application’s state is stored. It acts as the central hub for managing and updating your data.
* **[Action Reducers](store/action-reducer.md)**: Action reducers define how the state is updated in response to actions that are dispatched.
* **[Selectors](store/selectors.md)**: Selectors are functions that allow you to retrieve specific pieces of data from the store’s state in a structured way.
* **[Subscriptions](store/subscriptions.md)**: Subscriptions let your components listen for changes to state or selectors so they can react to updates in real-time.

This documentation will help you understand how to:
* Define an action reducer to update your store’s state.
* Create selectors to extract specific data from the store.
* Subscribe to state and selector changes to keep your components in sync with the application’s state.
