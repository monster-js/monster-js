# What is Weco JS?

**Weco JS** is a lightweight, flexible JavaScript framework that leverages **Web Components** to help developers build modular, reusable, and encapsulated web applications. Built with modern web standards in mind, Weco JS combines the power of Web Components with efficient Dependency Injection, a component-based architecture, and robust state management. This framework is ideal for projects of any scale, from small reusable widgets to complex single-page applications (SPAs).

## Key Features of Weco JS

Weco JS empowers developers with a feature set that enhances code organization, reusability, and testability. Here are some of the standout features that make Weco JS a powerful framework for modern web applications:

* **[Web Component-Based Architecture](main-concept/component.md)**: Weco JS components are Web Components, meaning they are custom elements with encapsulated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Web Components are natively supported by modern browsers, ensuring compatibility and flexibility across different frameworks.
* **[Dependency Injection (DI)](main-concept/dependency-injection.md)**: Manage shared dependencies efficiently, allowing you to control instances as singletons or transient objects, similar to Angular's DI system.
* **[State Management](store/weco-js-store.md)**: Track and share application data across components using built-in state management tools.
* **[Routing](router/weco-js-router.md)**: Navigate between views seamlessly with Weco JS’s router, which simplifies client-side navigation and offers Angular-style routing capabilities.
* **[Event Handling](main-concept/event-handling.md)**: Simplify event management with Weco JS’s responsive event-handling system for smooth component communication.
* **Efficient and Performant**: Weco JS is optimized for high performance, ensuring quick load times and responsiveness, even in complex applications.

## Why Web Components?

Using Web Components as the foundation for Weco JS offers several benefits:

* **Native Browser Support**: Web Components are part of the web platform, meaning they are compatible across all major browsers and can be used without additional dependencies.
* **Reusability and Encapsulation**: Each Web Component encapsulates its HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring that styles and behavior are isolated from the rest of the application. This isolation prevents CSS and JavaScript conflicts, making components highly reusable.
* **Framework Agnostic**: Because Web Components are standard HTML elements, they can be used in any framework or vanilla JavaScript. This makes Weco JS components portable and adaptable to different projects and tech stacks.
* **Enhanced Modularity**: By building with Web Components, Weco JS encourages modularity and clean separation of concerns, making your codebase easier to maintain and understand.

## Why Choose Weco JS?

Weco JS combines the flexibility and compatibility of Web Components with a structured framework to make development both intuitive and powerful. Here are a few reasons why Weco JS might be the ideal choice for your next project:

* **Familiar API**: Inspired by established frameworks like Angular and React, Weco JS provides a familiar API, reducing the learning curve for developers.
* **Enhanced Modularity and Reusability**: The Web Component-based structure promotes highly modular, testable, and reusable code.
* **Testability**: Weco JS is built with testing in mind. Its Dependency Injection and state management systems are designed to support unit testing, making it easy to test individual components and services.
* **Flexible Configuration**: Weco JS supports various configuration options, making it easy to override default behaviors and set up dependencies according to your application’s unique requirements.

## How Does Weco JS Work?

Weco JS simplifies application development by breaking down the structure into logical building blocks that work together seamlessly:

1. **[Components](main-concept/component.md)**: Weco JS uses Web Components as the primary building blocks, allowing you to create reusable, isolated parts of your UI. Components include their own template, styling, and logic, providing everything needed to render and manage specific pieces of your application.
2. **[Dependency Injection (DI)](main-concept/dependency-injection.md)**: With Weco JS's DI system, you can easily share services and other dependencies throughout your application. This feature allows you to control when and how instances are created, ensuring efficient management of shared services.
3. **[Routing](router/weco-js-router.md)**: Weco JS offers a client-side router, similar to Angular’s, that enables you to define and manage routes within your application. You can create paths for each view, set up route parameters, and even define nested routes for complex navigation flows.
4. **[State Management](store/weco-js-store.md)**: Track global or local state using Weco JS’s state management tools, providing a reliable way to keep your application’s data consistent and accessible across components.
5. **[Event Handling](main-concept/event-handling.md)**: Weco JS provides an event system for managing component events, making it easy to respond to user interactions and synchronize changes across your application.

## Summary

Weco JS is designed to empower developers by combining the versatility of Web Components with a structured, modular framework. Its component-based structure, Dependency Injection, and robust state management make it a versatile choice for creating modern web applications. Whether you’re building a small widget or a full-featured SPA, Weco JS provides the tools and structure needed to create efficient, maintainable, and testable applications.
