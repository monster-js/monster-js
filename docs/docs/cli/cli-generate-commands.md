# Generate commands

CLI is very helpful in generating files for MonsterJS application.
It makes creating components, services, modules and other files very easy.

The syntax for generate command is `mn generate <type> <name>`. The type is the type of file we want to generate and the name is the name of the files to be generated. The name can also be a pathname.

Here is an example command to generate a component.

The command above will generate the files like the following.

```
hello-world
    ├── hello-world.component.tsx
    └── hello-world.component.scss
```
