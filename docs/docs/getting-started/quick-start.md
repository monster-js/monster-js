There are many ways to setup a MonsterJS project.
One way is to use the [CLI](/docs/cli/cli-what-is-cli) but the easiest way is to clone the starter app from [GitHub](https://github.com/monster-js/starter-app).

## Create app

Clone the starter app from [GitHub](https://github.com/monster-js/starter-app).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/monster-js/starter-app.git monster-app
```
After cloning the repository, change directory into the starter project

```bash
cd monster-app
```

then install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
Start the local development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
Now we can view our app by pointing our browsers to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

## Project structure

After the setup is complete, you can see the file structure of project in the current directory.
